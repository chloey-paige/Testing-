## Parts of the Heart 

The parts of your heart are like the parts of a building. Your heart anatomy includes:

Walls.
Chambers that are like rooms.
Valves that open and close like doors to the rooms.
Blood vessels like plumbing pipes that run through a building.
An electrical conduction system like electrical power that runs through a building.

## Heart Walls, Chambers, and Valves 

Your heart walls are the muscles that contract (squeeze) and relax to send blood throughout your body. A layer of muscular tissue called the septum divides your heart walls into the left and right sides.

Your heart walls have three layers:

Endocardium: Inner layer.
Myocardium: Muscular middle layer.
Epicardium: Protective outer layer.
The epicardium is one layer of your pericardium. The pericardium is a protective sac that covers your entire heart. It produces fluid to lubricate your heart and keep it from rubbing against other organs.

Your heart has four separate chambers. You have two chambers on the top (atrium, plural atria) and two on the bottom (ventricles), one on each side of your heart.

Right atrium: Two large veins deliver oxygen-poor blood to your right atrium. The superior vena cava carries blood from your upper body. The inferior vena cava brings blood from your lower body. Then the right atrium pumps the blood to your right ventricle.
Right ventricle: The lower right chamber pumps the oxygen-poor blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. The lungs reload the blood with oxygen.
Left atrium: After the lungs fill your blood with oxygen, the pulmonary veins carry the blood to the left atrium. This upper chamber pumps the blood to your left ventricle.
Left ventricle: The left ventricle is slightly larger than the right. It pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.

Your heart valves are like doors between your heart chambers. They open and close to allow blood to flow through. They also keep your blood from moving in the wrong direction.
